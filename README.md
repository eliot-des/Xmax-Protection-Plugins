# Xmax Protection Plugins : Audio plugins for mechanical overload protection of loudspeakers.
---
This repository gather 3 different plugins that have been implemented in the frame of a Master 2 project schedule on 3 months, for which the aim was to develop algorithms to prevent mechanical overload of loudspeakers.
In the course of this research, 3 plugins were developed to evaluate the effectiveness of these different algorithms on a loudspeaker. 
These 3 plugins have been fully coded in C++ using the JUCE framework, after implementing and testing the algorithms in Python.

**Disclaimer:** The GUI style is the one seen on this [repository](https://github.com/TheAudioProgrammer/getting-started-book). Also, I'm a self-taugh C++ coder, therefore, some of the code could certainly be better written, both in terms of clarity and optimisation.
