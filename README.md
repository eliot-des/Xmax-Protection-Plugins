# Xmax Protection Plugins : Audio plugins for mechanical overload protection of loudspeakers.
---
This repository gather 3 different plugins that have been implemented in the frame of a Master 2 project schedule on 3 months, for which the aim was to develop algorithms to prevent mechanical overload of loudspeakers.
In the course of this research, 3 plugins were developed to evaluate the effectiveness of these different algorithms on a loudspeaker.
