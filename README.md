# Xmax Protection Plugins : Audio plugins for mechanical overload protection of loudspeakers.
---
by Eliot Deschang & Florian Marie 2025.

This repository gathers three different plugins implemented as part of a Master 2 project scheduled over three months. The aim of the project was to develop algorithms to prevent mechanical overload of loudspeakers.  
Mechanical overload is prevented by limiting the membrane excursion to a certain threshold, referred to as $X_{\text{max}}$.  
During the course of this research, three plugins were developed to evaluate the effectiveness of these algorithms on a loudspeaker.  
The plugins were fully coded in C++ using the JUCE framework, after implementing and testing the algorithms in Python.

**Disclaimer:** The GUI style is the one seen on this [repository](https://github.com/TheAudioProgrammer/getting-started-book). Also, I'm a self-taugh C++ coder, therefore, some of the code could certainly be better written, both in terms of clarity and optimisation.
